  <h1> About me </h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Hi, I am Vaibhav Mahajan a 20-year-old boy from the small town of Katol in Nagpur district. Currently, I am pursuing a BTech in
    Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at Yashwantrao Chavan College of Engineering, Nagpur, which is under RTMNU
    (university). My aspiration is to become a data scientist upon completing my BTech, but recently, I've been drawn
    towards web development, Python, and DSA. Although these areas are distinct from the data science field, I have also
    delved into statistics related to data science. Given the current job market's uncertainty due to the recession, I
    believe focusing on a wide range of skills is beneficial.</p>

  <p>I understand that mastering every skill is challenging, but gaining a basic understanding of various skills is
    valuable to me. This motivation drives me to explore different sectors continually. Currently in my 4th semester of
    the 2nd year, I realize I may have started a bit late, but I have already learned C and Java programming languages.
    Additionally, I participated in a science exhibition at YCCE, where I enhanced my knowledge. Although I didn't win,
    I learned JavaFX to complete my project for the exhibition.</p>

  <p>I have recently started diving into web development, Python, and DSA, and I have plans for the next two years of my
    engineering program. However, I understand these plans may evolve as I gain more knowledge. Despite exploring other
    areas, my primary focus remains on data science. I plan to dedicate the last three semesters of my engineering
    program entirely to data science, which I believe will be sufficient to develop a solid foundation in the field.
    This summarizes my journey as a Bachelor of Engineer student, always striving to learn and grow in various domains.
  </p>
